    Implementation notes:
     * it uses adjacency lists (a dict of lists) for storing nodes and their
       connected nodes.
     * it favors runtime performannce at the expense of build time performance
       e.g., we use lists for storing nodes even if checking that there are no
       duplicates nodes at build time is more expensive that using a set.
       Using a list is more efficient when traversing the graph instead of
       using a set (you usually iterate on all connected nodes anyway).

    Note that the generic type T must respect the Comparable contract and support
    <, >, and == operators.
